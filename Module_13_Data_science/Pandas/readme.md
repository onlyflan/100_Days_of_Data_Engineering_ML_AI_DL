*Setup Pandas:*

We are going to use Jupyter.

```bash
Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.
```

What is Pandas ?

The name Pandas has a reference to both panel data, and python data analysis and was created by Wes Mckinney in 2008.

Pandas is a python library used for working with data sets.

It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring and manipulating data.

Read and write data structures and different format: csv, XML, JSON, ZIP etc.
```

```bash

We are going to Learn:

1 - Data Structure IN Python Pandas

The Pandas provides two data structures for processing the data.

Series & DataFrame and Panel.

Series: It is defined as a one-dimensional array that is capable of storing various data types.

import pandas as pd

a = pd.Series()

print(a)


2 - DATAFRAMES IN Python PANDAS

3 - Aritmetic Operators In Python Pandas

4 - Delete AND Insert Data(Functions) IN Python Pandas

5 - Write CSV Using Pandas (Create A CSV File)

Difference between CSV and XLS (excel) file formats:

-- CSV format is a plain text format in which values are separated by commas (commas separated values).

-- XLS file format is an Excel Sheets binary file format which holds information about all the worksheets in a file, including both content and formatting.


6 - Read CSV Using Pandas.
CSV Files:

-- A simple way to store big data sets is to use CSV files (comma separated files).

-- CSV files contains plain text and is a well know format that can be read by everyone including Pandas.
