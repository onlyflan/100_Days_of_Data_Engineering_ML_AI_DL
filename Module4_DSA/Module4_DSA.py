* DATA STRUCTURES:

	Why we need to use data structure ?

	- Data structures: to store in an efficient way
	
	Why to use data structures ?

	- We often have the intuition --> if we want to make an algorithm fast,
		we have to optimize it
	- Avoid nested for loops
	- Make every calculation as fast as possible
	- But algorithms can be boosted up by proper data structures
	- Data structures make sure the running time will be better
	- Dijkstra algorithm
	- Without a proper data structure (heap / priority queue ) the running
		time would be quadratic // O(NÂ²) 
	- Priority queue approach makes sure the running time will be far
		better // O(N*logN)
