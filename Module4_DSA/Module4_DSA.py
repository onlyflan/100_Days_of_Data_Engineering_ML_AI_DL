* DATA STRUCTURES:

	Why we need to use data structure ?

	- Data structures: to store in an efficient way
	
	Why to use data structures ?

	- We often have the intuition --> if we want to make an algorithm fast,
		we have to optimize it
	- Avoid nested for loops
	- Make every calculation as fast as possible
	- But algorithms can be boosted up by proper data structures
	- Data structures make sure the running time will be better
	- Dijkstra algorithm
	- Without a proper data structure (heap / priority queue ) the running
		time would be quadratic // O(NÂ²) 
	- Priority queue approach makes sure the running time will be far
		better // O(N*logN)

* Difference between Data structures and Abstract Data Types (ADT)


- Abstract data types:

	- Basically this is the model(logical description) for a certain data structure
	- It is like a supertype in programming (so an interface in Java)
	- We just define what methods / functions the data structure will have,
		so we define the basic behavior
	- IMPORTANT: it is just the model, ADT does not specify the concrete implementation
		or programming language
	- "Basically what the user knows"
	- For example: stack --> push() pop() peek()

	abstract data types(1-Stack, 2-Queue, 3-Priority queue, 4-Dictionary / hashmap)
	data structures (1-array,linked list. 2-array,linked list. 3-heap. 4-array)

- Data structure:

	- The concrete implementation, the actual representation of the data
	- The aim is to be able to store and retrieve data in an efficient manner
	- What we want: to be able to insert / find items in O(1) time complexity and to be able to retrieve items in O(1) as well
	- For example: arrays, linked lists, banary trees ...
